```javascript
function f() {
  function Ctor() {}
  return { instance: new Ctor(), referenceToCtor: Ctor };
}

var a = f();
var b = f();

a.instance instanceof a.referenceToCtor; // true
b.instance instanceof a.referenceToCtor; // false
```

What does this tell us about the meaning of instanceof and function statements?

Does this mean that each time f is invoked a completely new Function-object named Ctor is instantiated and hence instanceof returns false.

Is this similar to the problems of instanceof Array and multiple windows?
